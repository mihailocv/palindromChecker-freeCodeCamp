# Palindrome Checker

This project is part of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" certification on freeCodeCamp. It is the first project to be completed independently without assistance. The task is simple: create a website that checks whether a word is a palindrome.

## Project Description

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. This project involves building a web application that allows users to input text and check if it is a palindrome.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Input field for entering text
- Button to check if the entered text is a palindrome
- Display result indicating whether the text is a palindrome or not

## How to Use

1. Open the website.
2. Enter the text you want to check in the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button.
4. The result will be displayed below the button, indicating whether the entered text is a palindrome.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for checking palindromes.
